About -- 
	- During submission the zip downloaded from github couldnt extract so my fellow members contribution were not submitted
	- and it was already too late as nor could i complete the excel sheet given
	- all the files including excel will be uploaded on github.
  	- same with the data_file folder in project, it will be reset with only restaurant manager with only user
	- version history is there(hopefully), (to show no foul play)

	- unless there is marks in the data file informative excel sheet then, i couldnt submit with anything, but i will be uploading that here with the information that it was supposed to have, and bin files will be created in runtime, in data_files folder when needed.

Instructions -- 
  - Restaurant manager will be registered
  - Id/gmail = 100000
  - Pass = 1000000
  - from there other users can be created and whatnot
